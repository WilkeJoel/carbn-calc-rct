This repo has a dual purpose: to show my experience through code samples; learn how to use React.

I am using the Carbon Footprint Calculator from the EPA, https://www3.epa.gov/carbon-footprint-calculator/

I created the current/live version of this site while working with ICF around 2015/2016. At the time I was working remotely and in over my head with no support available. 
The task at the time was to take the previous 'static' multi page version of the app and convert it to be more dynamic, in that users could edit their input to see how it affected their score without having to start the app over again with none of their previous entries saved.
The app performs all its calculations in the browser with no outside server calls. I worked on all the Javascript and another developer wrangled the supplied HTML & CSS into what you see.

While React alone is not the best solution for an app with so many calculations, I thought that being familiar with the app would allow me to both learn React in its theory and its real-world use.

Please keep in mind that I was/am completely new to React when starting this project.

Any questions let me know. 

I claim no 'ownership' to the code in its current site and
